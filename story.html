<p>
  Once upon a time, there lived two sister who were twins. They were living with their parent who were poor. Their parent struggled everyday to make both ends meet. Their father was full of wisdom and he always created time to counsel his daughters about the need to be patient in whatever they were doing. He talked to them about so many other virtues, lile tolerance, endurance, good behavior and he always ended his talk with a saying that ``whoever had patience had everything.`` When these twins were eighteen years old, their father died. They felt greatly the impact of their father`s demise because they lost a good companion who also counselled them and a breadwinner. Soon after the death of their father, their mother found things difficult. As a result of this she took the twins to her distant relation who was living a few kilometres away. Their mother`s relation accepted them but he was a cruel man who maltreated the girls so much. They were to do all the house chores and followed the man to the farm. While they worked so hard at home, the mans only daughter will sleep endlessly. She was very lazy and spoilt. One day, Bolaji, the man`s daughter went to the man`s room and stole four thousand naira.
